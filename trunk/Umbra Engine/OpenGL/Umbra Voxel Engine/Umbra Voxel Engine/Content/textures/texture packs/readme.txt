How to add texture packs:

1.	Create or add textures with the same names as the ones in the "standard" folder. 
	All the textures must be of the same format and size.

2.	Then make a new folder called something else, and put the textures there.

3.	The folder name should now show up in the launcher dropdown box (in the graphics tab), select the texture pack and click "launch".
